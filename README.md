This version is meant to be adapted for a 3D game. 
Currently buggy. Shows a 2D slice of the 3D space. Not spending much time on the visualization as it will be adapted to an existing game.
Still learning Rust. Changed to static sized arrays but have problems with the stack. Will use vectors again or Box them.
